**Submission deadline**: 18th November 2022, Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Submit on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2023/Bridge/AICS).


Our vision is that through an ongoing cross-disciplinary exchange between community members we can discover diverse ideas that have the potential to advance AI and climate science studies.
We have no strict constraints on the exact sub-topics of submissions, as long as they target the overall goal of bridging the fields of AI and climate science. 
Submissions are free to focus on a single particularly interesting synergy, or sketch a grander view. 
To provide some suggestions, contributions could center around the following aspects, including but not limited to:

- Incorporating physical domain knowledge in AI approaches
- Multi-modal climate data modeling
- Robust machine learning in space and time for weather and climate
- Quantifying and caliberating uncertainties of machine learning models for weather and climate forecasts
- Scaling AI infrastructure for petabyte-scale climate science datasets
